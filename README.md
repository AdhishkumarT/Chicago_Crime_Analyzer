Chicago Crime Analyzer - Power BI Project
Introduction
This project aims to analyze crime data from Chicago using Power BI. The goal is to create interactive reports and dashboards that help visualize crime trends, identify hotspots, and understand patterns in crime across different areas and times. By using Power BI's data visualization capabilities, I was able to turn raw data into meaningful insights.

Project Description
For this project, I used a dataset provided by Guvi containing crime reports from Chicago, which includes details such as crime type, location, and whether an arrest was made. The project focuses on identifying crime trends, crime types, and visualizing crime hotspots across the city.

Key Features
Crime Trends Over Time: Visualizing crime statistics over different time periods (years, months, days).
Crime Type Breakdown: Analyzing crime types like theft, assault, etc., to understand which crimes are most frequent.
Crime Hotspots: Using maps to identify areas with high crime rates and visualize crime density.
Arrest Analysis: Analyzing the correlation between crime incidents and arrests.
Dataset Information
Source: The dataset is provided by Guvi, which contains crime data from the city of Chicago.
Columns:
Date: The date and time when the crime occurred.
Crime Type: The type of crime (e.g., theft, robbery).
Location: The area or district where the crime occurred.
Arrest: Whether an arrest was made in the case (True/False).
Files Included
Chicago_Crime_Analysis.pbix: The Power BI report file, which contains all the visualizations and dashboards.

Conclusion
This project helped me develop my skills in using Power BI for data analysis and visualization. I learned how to clean and analyze data, create meaningful visualizations, and use Power BI's powerful tools to present insights in an interactive way.
